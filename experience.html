                            <li>This study analyzed black carbon pollution in Tehran and its link to
                                cardiorespiratory
                                deaths
                                between 2018 and 2019. Results showed BC levels, mainly from nighttime heavy-duty
                                vehicle
                                traffic,
                                were strongly correlated with increased mortality, with short lags between exposure and
                                death.
                                Using
                                health impact modeling, the study estimated that reducing BC could prevent over 15,000
                                annual
                                deaths. The findings underscore the urgent need for emission control measures to protect

                            <li>This study assessed the increasing levels of ground-level ozone in Tehran and its
                                short-term impact on mortality. Analysis showed that ozone concentrations, especially in
                                warm
                                seasons, are significantly linked to increased deaths, particularly from cardiovascular
                                causes, with a 3-day lag after exposure. A 10 ppb increase in ozone corresponded to a
                                ~1%
                                increase
                                in mortality. Modeling predicted that reducing ozone to EPA standards could prevent up
                                to
                                500
                                deaths annually. The findings highlight the growing health risks from ozone and the need
                                for
                                measures to reduce its precursors.</li>
