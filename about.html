                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hark, and well met! I give humble thanks for thy visit to my humble digital demesne.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Interdisciplinary Engineering at Northeastern University with a passion for
                    computational modeling, data science, and sustainability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My background is in civil and environmental engineering, but my curiosity extends well beyond that.
                    I enjoy exploring complex systems, building models, and turning messy data into meaningful insights;
                    whether it's related to climate, energy, public health, or completely unfamiliar territory. I
                    believe that great ideas often come from stepping outside your comfort zone, and I'm always open to
                    new challenges, even if they take me somewhere unexpected.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of research and coding, I enjoy cycling, designing 3D models, going on long walks, and
                    trying out new recipes. I'm also a big fan of board games and strategy puzzles; feel free to
                    challenge me to a round of

                    And lo, keep thine eyes keen; for hidden gems await those who seek with wonder.
